##An inverse kinematics solver for a 6 Degree of Freedom Stewart Platform
Since its first examination by Stewart in 1965 [Stewart1965], who aimed to design a basic platform with six degrees of freedom that is relevant to a number of areas, the Stewart Platform has been extensively investigated.

Initially focused on flight condition simulation, space conditions simulation, and tire testing, the Stewart Platform evolved into a versatile tool in the simulation of earth quakes or waves, as the end effector of wheel loaders [Gro√ümann2012], in animatronics, as the foundation for telescopes to follow stars, or to level DSLR cameras, but the Stewart Platforms' most significant applications have been in medicine, robotics, and precise tool movement.

To summarize, the platform exists in many different forms and may always be employed when great flexibility is necessary.

The inverse kinematics of a Stewart Platform is the computation of the leg length given the platform's needed location. The forward kinematics are indistinguishable and can only be resolved with additional restrictions or sensor input.
The Stewart Platform is made up of two frames, the base frame and the platform frame, which are linked together by six variable length legs. The platform may be moved in three translational dimensions and three rotational dimensions with this configuration.
